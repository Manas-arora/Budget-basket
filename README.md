# Budget-basket
Grocery shopping is an important yet costly job for many families in today's fast-paced society. Grocery prices change between retailers, making it difficult for customers to discover the best offers.
Existing price comparison platforms, such as Google Shopping and PriceRunner, primarily focus on electronics and consumer goods, lacking dedicated grocery price tracking features. 

Grocery shopping plays a crucial role in household budgets, and price disparities across retailers often lead to overspending. Consumers frequently lack access to a centralized system that provides a transparent and comparative overview of grocery prices. The Budget Basket project addresses this gap by offering a user-friendly web application that aggregates, analyzes, and presents grocery prices across various stores as shown in Fig.1. By integrating modern web technologies, database management, and analytics, this platform ensures a seamless, data-driven approach to smart shopping. Users can monitor price trends, compare prices across stores, and make cost-effective purchasing decisions with ease.
